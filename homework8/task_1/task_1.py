"""
Homework 1:
We have a file that works as key-value storage, each line is represented as key
and value separated by = symbol, example:

name=kek last_name=top song_name=shadilay power=9001

Values can be strings or integer numbers. If a value can be treated both as a
number and a string, it is treated as number.

Write a wrapper class for this key value storage that works like this:

storage = KeyValueStorage('path_to_file.txt') that has its keys and values
accessible as collection items and as attributes. Example: storage['name']
# will be string 'kek' storage.song_name # will be 'shadilay' storage.power
# will be integer 9001

In case of attribute clash existing built-in attributes take precedence.
In case when value cannot be assigned to an attribute (for example when
there's a line 1=something) ValueError should be raised. File size is expected
to be small, you are permitted to read it entirely into memory.
